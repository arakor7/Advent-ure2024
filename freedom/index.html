        <p>Gradually, the path you're following starts to slope upwards, and far, far ahead, you think you may actually see a bit of daylight. You quicken your pace as you lead the group towards it. As you get closer, the light seems to dim, and you worry that there's another trap ahead, but your fear subsides when you realize that it's just the sun setting, after what was probably the longest day of your life.</p>
        <p>As excited as you are to see daylight again, you decide it's probably best to camp inside the cave rather than out in the open tundra, and you do your best to get comfortable. You're just starting to nod off, as the final rays of light fade outside, when you hear a soft growl, and a few loud sniffs. At the same time, you feel a warmth coming from the pocket holding the pyramid stone. You're not sure *how* you know this, but it feels like it wants to help.</p>
