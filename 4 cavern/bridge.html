        <p>As you run your finger over the last word, you can briefly see the shape of a glowing bridge on the pillar before the words flash brightly, then go out. The area between the chasm shimmers, and you see a geyser of water rush up from the darkness. As it reaches the top, it begins to freeze, forming a large bridge made of ice. You just hope that was the last defense of this place that you’ll encounter. </p>
