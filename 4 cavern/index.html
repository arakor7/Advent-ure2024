        <p>Exiting the tunnel you emerge into a dark cavern, with a worn pathway leading you onward. You follow it for a while, listening to the drips and drops of water as it falls from stalactites onto stalagmites. You walk for an hour, maybe two, before coming to a deep, deep chasm, with another podium nearby. Across the way, you can see the pathway continues. If you can find a way across safely, you think you’ll be able to finally escape.</p>
        <p>As you are contemplating exactly how you can make it across the chasm, Sharash calls out to you.  "Look at this!"  You walk over to where he is standing in front of a group of words carved into a pillar, with some crude pictures underneath. "Watch this," he says, running a scaled finger over some of the words. As his finger passes over flood, the letters glow dimly. However, when he reaches heat, the letters go dark. "Weird, right? Looks like only some of the words glow."</p>
