        <p>You fall to the ground, dropping the box in the process. As the rumbling subsides, you see the area in which the box was found has opened up wider, revealing a small room, and what looks like a doorway on the other side of the expanse. You stand up and poke your head around the corner of the cell, checking to see if there are any guards nearby. The entire end of the hallway is buried in, with rocks, dirt, and furniture sealing the entrance. You look back in the cell to see the <Species> and <Species> getting to their feet, but <Species> seems to be dead, with a large armoire laying across their chest.</p>
        <p>You look at the two others, and say “Well, if we’re going to be breaking out of prison together, we might as well be on a first name basis. I’m <Name>.” The {{descriptions and names of the other characters here}}.</p>
        <p>As you climb through the makeshift tunnel, the air grows moist, and the rank smell of mold attacks your nostrils. You move from empty room to empty room, each with open doorways before finally finding one with a moss-covered wooden door half blocking it. You kick it a few times, and it easily gives way. Inside, you find the remains of a small armory, with various equipment. Apparently the magical charm that protected it was still partially intact, because while old, the equipment overall is in fairly good condition. You take the time to equip yourselves before moving on.</p>
        <p>Eventually you come to a different area. Overgrown with strange plants and vines, the path ahead looks treacherous, and <Name?> points out that there are some strange spores floating in the air, that probably wouldn’t be too great to breathe in. <Other name> seems to have found some strange control panel, with various letters written on it in common.</p>
