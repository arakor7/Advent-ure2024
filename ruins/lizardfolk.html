        <p>It takes you some time to find the chest; this one was hidden far better than the last one, and it's obvious that the lizardfolk weren't aware of its presence. As you search the area, you're happy to find some other items from the lizardfolk that might be helpful in your travels. Finally, you find what you're looking for and open the chest excitedly.
        <p>As you pick up the somewhat diamond shaped gemstone, your vision fades to black as you collapse to the ground. There's an old building here, almost churchlike in its design, though it's clearly no longer standing. Piles of rubble make up its most distinctive features. You seem to walk through the area slowly, trying to get your bearings. When suddenly, once again, your vision starts to pull back. You are shown an arial view of ruins as you begin to move to the northwest. As you move, you see a large swamp, which gradually turns into a deep forest, before finally giving way to sparse farmlands, strange, but more familiar looking the further your vision travels. Again, your vision pulls downward, and as it crashes into your head, you gasp awake.  </p>
